Countless websites are offering you ways to earn extra cash, from taking surveys to completing microtasks. However, not all of them are legitimate, and many don't pay their users as much as they advertise. This article will take you through five of the best online earning sites to make you money!</p><h1>Swagbucks</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-5" href="../Swagbucks.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">Swagbucks</a> is a legitimate and popular online income-earning website. You can earn money by watching videos, completing surveys, shopping online and more. It is free to sign up and start making money. You can redeem your earnings for gift cards and other rewards.</p><h1>Inbox Dollars</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-6" href="https://www.inboxdollars.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">Inbox Dollars</a> is a site that pays you to complete surveys, play games and watch videos. It's an easy way to make money online and doesn't require special skills or knowledge. You can get started making money with Inbox Dollars by signing up for an account using our link below.</p><p>Once you've signed up, you'll be able to earn points by completing tasks on the site, such as taking surveys or watching videos and referring friends who also sign up with your referral link (there's no limit). Once enough points have been earned, they can be redeemed for cash via PayPal or Amazon gift card.</p><p>Payments range from $5 to $50 per survey, depending on length and difficulty; however, it usually takes about 100 points before receiving payment, so don't expect to rake in the big bucks on the first day!</p><h1>Toluna</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-7" href="https://www.tolunastart.com/" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">Toluna</a> is an online survey site that pays you to give your thoughts on products and services. You can earn points, which can be redeemed for gift cards or other rewards. You can also get paid for completing surveys on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The site offers a free membership that allows you to complete up to 10 surveys per month but limits the number of points you can earn from each one (100), so it's recommended that you upgrade if you want more opportunities to make money with Toluna.</p><p>To sign up for a free account, click here</p><h1>Crowdflower</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-8" href="https://visit.crowdflower.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">Crowdflower</a> is a platform that allows you to earn money by completing simple tasks online. There are three types of functions: CrowdFlower, CrowdFlower Mobile and Survey. You can select either one or all three options when completing a task. Each task has its payout amount, usually between $0.10 and $2 per minute, depending on the difficulty level and other factors.</p><p>Crowdflower offers three ways for you to earn money:</p><ul><li>Tasks – complete small micro-tasks like tagging pictures or transcribing audio files</li><li>Surveys – answer questions about brands, products and services</li><li>Mobile – complete quick surveys while on the go</li></ul><h1>Fiverr</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-9" href="../Fiverr.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">Fiverr</a> is the site that can give you more money than any other online earning website. Fiverr is a marketplace for freelancers who sell their services for $5 each or less. It's like an auction house where buyers and sellers meet up to make deals, but instead of paying thousands of dollars for an item, you pay $5 (or less) for your custom-made service.</p><p>The word "Fiverr" comes from combining the words "five" and "dollar." You might wonder why anyone would want to spend money on service when they could do it themselves. Or why would someone offer their time at such low prices? The answer is simple: Because they have no choice! If you don't have any professional skills or experience (or if you do), then this website will be beneficial in earning some extra cash!</p><p>Although Fiverr has become famous over the years due to its low prices and high demand among customers, there are certain things that we should avoid while using this platform so as not to get caught red-handed by its moderators at later stages.</p><h1>Amazon Mechanical Turk</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-10" href="https://www.mturk.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> (or mTurk) is one of the best websites to earn money online. It's a crowdsourcing service allows you to make money by completing small tasks, known as "HITs" (Human Intelligence Tasks).</p><p>You can find HITs related to data entry, text processing and research. One of the best things about this website is that it's pretty flexible regarding time management and payment options. You can set your schedule for working on these tasks and get paid in your currency - USD or Indian Rupees.</p><p>The most popular method of payment on this site is through Amazon gift cards which are readily convertible into cash at any store where Amazon products are sold, such as Walmart or Target; however, there are also other options like PayPal and direct bank transfer available as well but they're rarer than gift cards since they're not always readily available on mTurk itself but will only come up if someone offers them up themselves first before accepting any other donation type like what we'll mention below later down below under: "other ways".</p><h1>iWriter</h1><p><a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-block-d98a-11" href="https://www.iwriter.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0">iWriter</a> is a website that pays you to write articles. It's easy to start, and you can earn up to $5 per 500 words. You can write about any topic, so it's a great place to practice your writing skills or explore new areas of interest. At iWriter, there are no fees or quotas for submitting content—write what you know and enjoy!</p><p>These are legit, online income-earning sites.</p><p>These are legit, online income-earning sites—some genuine opportunities to make money from home if you know where to look.</p><p>These sites are easy to join and use.
