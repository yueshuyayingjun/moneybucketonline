The unemployment rate is higher than ever, and people are losing their homes left and right. But it doesn't have to be this way! Here are some things you can do to earn money from home:</p><h2>"It's the ECONOMY, stupid."</h2><p>How is the economy doing? If you ask most people, they'll tell you it's not doing well. But if you dig deeper, it turns out everyone wants to know how their finances are doing.</p><p>The economy is a reflection of how well people are doing in their jobs and their personal lives. The stock market reflects the value of companies that employ millions of Americans and sell products to consumers worldwide—how they're doing depends on how much money they make or lose each quarter (or year).</p><p>You can think of your financial situation as being part of a broader economic cycle: Your work pays your bills and helps build up resources like savings accounts; this allows you to afford things like going out to dinner or buying clothes at stores; these purchases generate revenue for businesses who rely on customers with money; those businesses then employ more workers so they can continue making profits while also spending money on new supplies (like raw materials) themselves. It all works together!</p><h2>The Housing Bubble</h2><p>The government caused the housing bubble. The government wanted to make homeownership affordable for everyone, so they made it easier to get loans and mortgages. They also made it easier to refinance mortgages, which allowed people who couldn't pay their bills to keep borrowing money from their banks at high rates. Banks then bundled up all of these mortgages into packages called "mortgage-backed securities," which they sold as investments on Wall Street.</p><p>For this scheme to work smoothly, house prices needed to keep rising—but when they did stop growing, millions of homeowners were stuck with houses worth less than what they owed them in terms of payments (called negative equity). This meant that many people could no longer afford their homes—and so many were forced out onto the streets or into foreclosure (where a bank takes back its property).</p><h2>The Debt Crisis</h2><p>The debt crisis is a global problem. It's an economic problem. It's a social problem. It's a political problem and even a moral and spiritual one, too!</p><p>The main reason why people get into debt is that they want more out of life than they can afford. They want to show off their wealth by buying expensive cars or clothes beyond their means—and then they have to borrow money from banks at high-interest rates to keep up with all their fancy purchases.</p><h2>The Unemployment Crisis</h2><p>According to a recent US Department of Labor study, approximately 3.6 million American workers were unemployed in April 2019. This figure represents an increase from the previous month, a trend that has been ongoing for years, with no end in sight. The unemployment rate for African Americans has reached an all-time high at 8.2 per cent—a 7 per cent increase since last year.</p><p>The main reason for these numbers is that there are not enough jobs available for people who want them—but another reason: wages have remained stagnant or declined over time, even as corporate profits have increased dramatically during this same period (see graph below).</p><h2>College Education is too Expensive.</h2><p>You're probably going to college if you're like the average American. It only makes sense: a college education is associated with more jobs, better pay, and less unemployment. However, many people feel that they can't afford to go to school. Tuition has increased faster than inflation or wages in recent years, so it can be hard for students to pay their way through school without taking out loans that they won't be able to repay later on in life. And while most people think of college as the key to success (and it often is), not everyone gets that chance—many drops out because they have no other option but debt or joblessness.</p><h2>Internet Home Businesses Are the Future</h2><p>You might think that investing in an internet home business is not a good idea because you're worried it might not work out. But don't worry, because if you choose to invest in an internet home business, there is no way that you can lose.</p><p>I say this because the internet has been around for so long and has become such a huge part of our lives that it doesn't make sense to ignore it. The best thing about these types of businesses is the fact that they are recession-proof, which means they are still going strong even during hard times, which means regardless of what happens in the economy (or politics), people will always need what these businesses have offered them: convenience and cost effectiveness!</p><p>Another great advantage of starting your own business online is how easy it is! You don't need special training or qualifications – all you need are ideas about how something could be done differently/better/more efficiently than before!</p><h2>So what can we do?</h2><p>Start a blog and make money from ads on it.</p><p>Open up an affiliate marketing site, where you get paid to promote products or services that companies pay you for.</p><p>Make apps and sell them on the app store (if you're into programming).</p><p>Create a YouTube channel, record videos about your hobby or interest, and then monetize those videos by adding ads before or after your content plays when people watch them (this is how I make my living).</p><p>You can make money from home by taking advantage of modern technology.</p><p>The internet has made it easier to find work from home. There are many ways to make money from home. Some jobs are better than others, and some pay more than others. Some jobs require less training than others, but all of them will allow you to earn money while doing something that interests you.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope we've inspired you to take advantage of the opportunities. With the right mindset and hard work, you can build a successful business from your home that will change your life—and maybe even the world!</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
